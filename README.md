#### This is a web-application that will become my portfolio as a web developer

#### By Quinn Miller

## Description

_As of Feb 15th 2019_
This project will be a website that shows off the work that I've done as a junior web developer. I will use React to build this app from the ground up. Starting with a blueprint of how this app will be structured, which i will include in the readme. Eventually it will have a few pictures of me, a bio section, and showcase the projects that i am most proud of.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

_As of Feb 15th 2019_
_There isn't anything here yet other than an initialized React environment_

_In the future_

2. You must clone this project to your machine.
3. In a terminal window, navigate to the project's root folder (where you see package.json) and type 'npm install'.
