      <p>Hi! Thanks taking the time to read my coverletter. I am currently a student at Epicodus, a coding bootcamp in Portland Oregon. My education at Epicodus has given me many of the technical skills I need to be a great team-member of CD Baby. I decided to attend Epicodus because of my passion for the web and interest in open-source development. I started by familiarizing myself with the command line and Git, while making web-pages using html and css. Later in the course i learned Javascript and Ruby along with the basics of SQL. I have no doubt about my ability to learn new things on the job, given my familiarity with similar technologies and my track record of learning as I go.</p>

      <p>Before Epicodus, I worked as a customer service associate for QFC. I strove for excellence and customer satisfaction in my work as a cashier and produce clerk, making sure i resolve issues thoroughly and professionally. Also informing the customer of the product they are buying and pointing out any problems or caviates. The many years i spent doing this job shows that i work well with a diverse, fluidly changing team, in paralell with the general public. My deliverables showed that my detail-oriented approach paid off, as I was consistently in the top 10% of representatives for customer satisfaction.</p>

      <p>Music has always been a part of my life. During my highschool years, learning to play my favorite songs on guitar became an obsession. I played in a few bands, playing house shows and venues here and there. After learning to record music on my computer, my passion moved to producing and engineering my own music. This has led me to focus solely on independant artists and labels.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>I think this would be a great opportunity to apply my tech skills to something that I'm passionate about. Thanks!</p>
